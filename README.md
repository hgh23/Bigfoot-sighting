# BigFOOT-PowerBI: UFO Sightings Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
This project consists of two Power BI dashboards that visualize and analyze UFO sighting data. The dashboards demonstrate various ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) skills applied to process and present the data effectively.

## ETL Skills Demonstrated

### Extract
- Data sourcing: Collected UFO sightings data from [specify your data source]
- Data import: Imported data into Power BI from [CSV/Excel/SQL database/etc.]

### Transform
- Data cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and corrected data types
- Date/time parsing: Converted sighting date and time strings into proper datetime format
- Geospatial data processing: Extracted and formatted latitude and longitude data for mapping
- Text analysis: Performed sentiment analysis on sighting descriptions (if applicable)
- Calculated columns: Created additional columns such as sighting duration, day of week, etc.

### Load
- Data modeling: Established relationships between sightings and location tables
- Measures creation: Developed DAX measures for sighting frequency, average duration, etc.
- Data categorization: Properly categorized columns for effective visualization (e.g., locations for mapping)

## Visualization Techniques
- Interactive maps: Displayed UFO sighting locations geographically using Power BI's map visual
- Time series analysis: Visualized sighting frequency over time with line and area charts
- Filters and slicers: Implemented date range, location, and shape filters for data exploration
- Custom visuals: Utilized custom Power BI visuals for unique representations of the data

## Additional Skills
- Dashboard design: Created an intuitive and visually appealing layout with consistent color schemes
- Performance optimization: Implemented query folding and reduced data model size for efficiency
- Documentation: Created this README and inline documentation within the Power BI file

## Future Enhancements
- Implement machine learning models to predict future sighting hotspots
- Integrate real-time data feeds for up-to-date sighting information
- Develop a web application to allow users to submit new sightings directly

## How to Use
1. Download the .pbix file from this repository
2. Open the file using Power BI Desktop (available for free from Microsoft)
3. Explore the dashboards using the interactive filters and visualizations
4. To update the data, refresh the data source connections within Power BI
